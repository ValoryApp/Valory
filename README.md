**Valory** is a feature-rich tool that provides a sleek and customizable rank overlay for **Valorant** streamers.  
It’s perfect for enhancing your stream’s visuals while keeping your viewers engaged with up-to-date stats.  

This project started as a fork of [davizeragod](https://davizeragod.github.io/) but has since grown into a fully independent and unique tool.  
Inspired by [tracker.gg/overlays](https://tracker.gg/overlays), Valory combines aesthetics with functionality to elevate your streaming experience.
